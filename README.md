# Collatz-Connjecture
Basic code for the Collatz Connjecture to calculate numbers in the sequence.

- The Collatz Algorithm states that you can take a random number x:
- If x is an odd number, you use the formula 3x+1 or you multiply it by 3 and add one.
- Else, if it's an even number, you divide the number by 2.
- No matter what number you start with, you'll end up with the combination 4 -> 2 -> 1, which loop back to eachother.

- The unsolved connjecture is named after it's founder, Lothar Collatz.
